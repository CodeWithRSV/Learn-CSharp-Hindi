# Summary

This curriculum is intended as a roadmap to learn C# using my youtube channel [Code with RSV](https://www.youtube.com/@CodewithRSV).
It is no secret nowadays that online platforms are full of free learning materials.

*People Donâ€™t Pay for Content. They Pay for Organized Content.*

So as part of this roadmap, I have tried to organize all my content  in a way that can be used by students to learn C# from whatever level they are currently on.


# Prerequisite

**There are the following prerequisites to this course**:
 - Basic education (It is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.)
 - Personal computer (Access to a personal computer with working internet is needed to run install the software needed for the course)
 - Will to learn (Finishing any self-taught course requires discipline and good habits to continue learning on your own)

# Curriculum

**The curriculum is designed as follows**:
- [**Level 0**: Introduction to Computers](#introduction-to-computers)
- [**Level 1**: Introduction to Programming with C#](#introduction-to-programming-with-c)

## Introduction to Desktop UI

Once you have learnt the c# basics it is good to practice with Desktop projects to get comfortable with C# as they provide you with more features to experiment with than Console projects. This is not madatory if you are leaning C# specifically for the purpose of Web Development or Game Developement.

### Winforms

Easiest to get started and build small applications but not recommended for large projects.

**Topics covered**:
`Winforms Designer`
`Align Controls`
`Data Binding`
`Custom Controls`
