# Summary

This curriculum is intended as a roadmap to learn C# using online materials.
It is no secret nowadays that online platforms are full of free learning materials.
*People Donâ€™t Pay for Content. They Pay for Organized Content.*
So as part of this roadmap, we have tried to organize the best content we found on the internet in a way that can be used by students to learn C# from whatever level they are currently on.


# Prerequisite

**There are the following prerequisites to this course**:
 - Basic education (It is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.)
 - Personal computer (Access to a personal computer with working internet is needed to run install the software needed for the course)
 - Will to learn (Finishing any self-taught course requires discipline and good habits to continue learning on your own)

# Curriculum

**The curriculum is designed as follows**:
- [**Level 0**: Introduction to Computer Science](#introduction-to-computer-science)
- [**Level 1**: Introduction to Programming Concepts](#introduction-to-programming-concepts)
- [**Level 2**: Basics of C#](#basics-of-c)
